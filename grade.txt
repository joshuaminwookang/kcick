/* INTERPRETER */
Q1a.   10/10 ProjectParser.fs, ProjectInterpreter.fs, Program.fs present and compiles

Q1b.   10/10 represents some form of data in AST

Q1c.   10/10 represents some form of operation in AST

Q1d.   10/10 parser recognizes subset of possible programs

Q1e.   10/10 evaluator evaluates subset of possible programs

It would be helpful if you provided some sample queries.  I was able to determine, by reading your code, that I could ask:

"How many oranges can fit in a pool?"

You should probably provide a friendlier answer to queries that you don't know, since you will never know all the answers.  E.g., when I ask:

"How many knuckles can fit in a sandwich?"

The answer is:

Unhandled Exception: System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException: The given key was not present in the dictionary.
   at Microsoft.FSharp.Collections.MapTreeModule.find[TKey,TValue](IComparer`1 comparer, TKey k, MapTree`2 m)
   at ProjectInterpreter.eval(Header e_0, Object e_1, Category e_2, Object e_3, FSharpMap`2 database) in
   ...

Also, that's a really small pool.  More of a puddle.

/* SPECIFICATION */
Q1f.   10/10 spec doc has formal grammar

In this section, do not use the AST names for grammar productions.  For example, for header, you have

<header> ::= HowMany
          |  HowOften
	  |  etc

I think you want

<header> ::= How many
          |  How often

and you should leave out whatever you have not yet implemented.  Think of the format spec as literally that---a document that specifies _exactly_ how the program works.

Q1g.   10/10 spec doc has informal semantics

This is good.
